Truust simplifies the creation of diverse payment flows, catering to e-commerce, split payments, and more.

## Overview

Our products streamline the acceptance of payments on your platforms, consisting of three primary elements:

1. **The Dashboard** - A user-friendly interface for managing your business activities.
2. **The API** - Powerful underlying architecture that drives all our services.
3. **The Hosted Checkout** - An easy integration solution that leverages the capabilities of our API.

### The Dashboard

Our Dashboard provides the essential tools to operate your business efficiently. It enables you to configure orders, manage transactions, and generate reports directly. [Learn more about the Dashboard](/dashboard).

### The API

Truust’s API is a comprehensive toolkit that enables your developers to integrate directly with your systems, streamlining processes and customizing interactions with our payment gateway. Detailed documentation is available to support your development team. [Explore our developer docs](/developers).

### The Hosted Checkout

The Hosted Checkout offers a straightforward path to take full advantage of our API's capabilities. You can embed the `buyer_link` within your site or app, or distribute it through various channels like email, SMS, or social media platforms to facilitate payments.

## Environments

Truust utilizes two distinct environments:
- **[Sandbox Dashboard](https://dashboard-sandbox.truust.io/)** - A secure testing environment.
- **[Production Dashboard](https://dashboard.truust.io/)** - The live production environment.

Each environment functions independently, requiring separate credentials and configurations.
